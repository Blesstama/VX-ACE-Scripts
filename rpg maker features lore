BLESSTAMA'S GUIDE ABOUT FEATURES/TRAITS

OVERALL INFORMATION:

* = these effects multiplied by yourself
(ex. weapon give 50% effect, armor 25%, you have 12,5% effect totally)

+ = these effects stacks with each others
(ex. weapon give +10% bleed chance, armor +15%, you have 25% totally)

if nothing then they have own effect

CATEGORY 1: RATE

* Element Rate: affects how much damage you take from skill/item if that skill/item has element rate
(ex. skill have physical element 1k damage, you have physical 50%, you take 500 damage)
located:Game_Battler, Calculate Damage, value *= item_element_rate(user, item)
Extra fact:if your skill have normal attack element, it will instead took all elements you have as trait and pick best

* Debuff Rate:affect chance to apply any debuffs
(ex. all debuffs have 100% chance to apply unless code fuckery, you have 30% resist so if you ignore luk you have, well,
70% chance to be inflicted instead)
located:Game_Battler, [Debuff] Effect

* State rate:same as debuff rate, expect for states (also multipler)
located:Game_Battler, [Add State] Effect: Normal Attack, [Add State] Effect: Normal
Extra fact:when you apply any states, Normal Attack and Normal doesn't stack with each other
(ex. you have 10% chance to apply bleed with attacks, skill have 20%, both works independently)

State Resist:makes you fully immuned to be applied by any states at all
Extra fact:yes, you can be immortal if give yourself State Resist:death.

CATEGORY 2: PARAM

*Parameter:affects how much stats you have
(ex. You have 100 atk, weapon gives 115% atk and armor 125%, you get 143 atk totally)

SHORT EXPLANATION OF EACH STAT

HP:number of how long you exist 

MP:number of your usage for skills most of time

ATK:damage physical (if skill use it)

DEF:defense physical (if skill use it)

MAT:damage magical (if skill use it)

MDF:defense magical (if skill use it)

AGI:how fast you move (affects chance to escape, attack first or being surprised, order of attacking)

(you don't need code cus there's nothing to alter lol)

Extra facts:

1.1)chance to escape works as
150% - entire enemy troop agi/entire party of your agi
entire troop/party means:
you have actors with 999, 150, 34 and 89
your agi is (999+150+34+89)/4 = 318
if your team agi is twice higher than enemy one, you always escape, else you can fail and get 10% escape chance buff each fail
located:BattleManager,  Create Escape Success Probability, def self.make_escape_ratio

1.2)attack first or being surprised
absolutely useless shit
base chance to attack first:3%
if higher agi:5%
base chance to be surprised:3%
if higher agi:1%
located:Game_Party, Calculate Probability of Preemptive Attack, def rate_preemptive(troop_agi)/def rate_surprise(troop_agi)

1.3)order of attack
all of this is random in term of
you always have 100% of your agi when 25% of it and 5 flat bonus is random
example:you have 100 agi, enemy around 120
you CAN overspeed him if you lucky because
your max speed:from 100 to 100 + (100/4 + 5) = 130 (100-130)
enemey max speed:from 120 to 120 + (120/4 + 5) = 155 (120-155)
there's also 2 more factors:skill speed and actor speed
actor speed pure trash explained later in category 3: attack
skill speed:each skill can have bonus to speed. It's purely flat bonus no randomizing or multiplying
extra facts 2:if you use skill with 2000 skill speed and 500 skill speed, game will take lowest one or 500 skill speed as main bonus.
located:Game_Action, Calculate Action Speed, def speed

LUK:affects chance to apply debuffs

extra fact:it's dogshit
so this is formula: (100% + (user luk - target luk) * 0,001, 0).max
problem 1:if you have advantage, enemy will NEVER be able to apply any states or debuffs on you
problem 2:you need to REALLY FUCKING TRY to add because you need OVER 1000 luk 
to have doubled chance to apply anything or being immuned so it's barely exist
located:Game_Battler, Get Effect Change Rate by Luck, def luk_effect_rate(user)

+Ex-Parameters 
1)HIT, despite calculate by (+10 HIT and +15 HIT means +25 HIT), affects skill as multipler
